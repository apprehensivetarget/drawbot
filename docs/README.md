## Files documentation

The bot will create **3** json files in the **vars** folder:

### vars/config.json

This file stocks your private logins and info's to make to bot running.
You can find a **config.example.json** file in the **vars** folder.

> `config.json` **Example**

```json5
{
    token: "( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",
    channelID: "000000000000000000",
    username: "demonstration",
    password: "pronotevs",
    url: "https://demo.index-education.net/pronote/eleve.html?login=true",
}
```

copy that file as **config.json** and fill in the values as follows:

-   `"token"`: your bot token. <br>
-   `"prefix"`: the prefix your bot will use. <br>
-   `"channelID"`: the ID of the Discord channel. <br>
-   `"username"`: your Pronote username. <br>
-   `"password"`: your Pronote password. <br>
-   `"url"`: the url of your pronote client. <br>

If you can't connect to Pronote, check if your establishment is not using an
ENT. In this case, see what you need to do with the help of the pronote wrapper
project: [pronotepy](https://github.com/bain3/pronotepy)

Files `vars/devoirs.json` and `vars/grades.json` are here to stock what's has
been already sent, so you don't need to care about them
